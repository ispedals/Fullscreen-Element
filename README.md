# Fullscreen Element

(Update April 2017) Non Web Extension addons will no longer work starting from Firefox 57, and the Web Extension API as of April 2017 does not provide a way to determine which element was selected. Therefore, this addon will stop working after Firefox 57


Addon for Firefox for Desktop that adds an item to the context menu to fullscreen the currently selected element.

This can be used to fullscreen an image, table, etc.
